# Git-Lite

### About this project

**Git-lite is a command-line tool that mimics the local features of Git, including committing, merging, amending, branching, etc.**

**Skills/Technologies used:** Java, Git, data structures (linked lists,
trees, graphs)

### What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in
a set of files. To read more about Git and what it can do, checkout

### Why did I make this project?

As an aspiring developer, my goal was to demystify the inner workings
of a tool I use almost daily as part of my workflow. My hope is that
I come away with a solid intuition of how Git manages my files.

In the process, I also have the opportunity to better understand how
data structures are used in larger software projects and learn a little
bit more about Java.

This project was inspired by the following sources:
- This brilliant [article](https://blog.jayway.com/2013/03/03/git-is-a-purely-functional-data-structure/), which provides a unique perspective on Git.
- A project completed by students at UC Berkeley (which is where the starter code for some of the file I/O operations come from).
